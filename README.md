# Project Vision
## Introduction
**Surveillance** means safety. Despite so much surveillance, the crime rates are increasing. The problem lies in the fact that inspecting several hundreds and thousands of videos is very laborous and time-intensive task. Only after a crime is committed, these footages are inspected to ***find the crime scenes evidence***, which proves to be highly inefficient considering the massive amount of footages. This manual task provides evidence in court but is rarely used to ***prevent crime or react to it in real-time***.    
<br>

## üî≠ &nbsp; About this Project
In this project, we aim to develop a **real-time crime detection technology** that can be integrated with any security system, to ensure public safety through **visual crowd surveillance**.<br>
We have devised a complete software solution for safety and surveillance where we convert these CCTVs from an evidence collection to a crime prevention and detection tool to ensure safety and security.<br> This real-time crime detection technology is integrated with security systems and Desktop Application to get push-in notifications in case any suspicious activity is discovered.
The system will detect and simultaneously alert any violent activity captured by the camera. <br>The technologies encompasses domains of Computer Vision and Deep Learning models like **CNN, R-CNN, LSTM**. The dataset consists of 500+ videos scraped off internet and categorized into ***violent and non-violent*** activities.

## üíº &nbsp; Testing
Our source code can be tested and contributed to using the following steps:
### 1. Website
Execute the following sequence of code to start contributing and testing:
- Open the directory labelled Website using the command
    ```sh
    cd Website
    ```

- Install all the dependencies using
    ```sh
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Run the migrations using the following commands
    ```sh
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    ```
    ```sh
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

- Run the Django server by
    ```sh
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```

<br>

*Note :*  In case you encounter errors during migrations, make sure that you have access rights to *db.sqlite3* file. You can use the following command to rectify permission denied error
```sh
chown *username* db.sqlite3
```

Run the migrations again to continue.

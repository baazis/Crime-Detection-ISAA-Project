# RAL TIME VIOLENCE DETECTION USING VIDEO SURVEILLANCE
## Introduction
‚ÄúSurveillance is safety and security.‚Äù

Despite the increased surveillance using many CCTV cameras, people etc the crime rates are rising rapidly. Many countries now employ public video surveillance as a primary tool to monitor population movements and to prevent crime and terrorism, both in the private and public sectors.
The idea is to develope a full software solution for safety and surveillance that turns traditional CCTVs from only recording / evidence collecting into a crime prevention and detection tool, providing safety and security. This tech will work in real-time and show the statistics of all the CCTV surveillance.   
Our proposed method will ensure public safety and security without requiring any human intervention, while also providing an immediate alarm to the appropriate authorities. Our method attempts to instil a sense of security in men and women through crowd monitoring and behavioural analysis.
Through our proposed approach, the constant rise of criminal actions, their unexpectedness, and the breadth of harm that can be caused can be exponentially curtailed.

## NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE (CUSTOMIZED CNN) 
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance to various aspects/objects in the image/video and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a CNN is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-coded, with enough training, CNN have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.

Some parameters that we are using are

            	Optimizer: Adam

            	Loss: BinaryCrossEntropy

            	Epochs: 30

            	steps_per_epoch: 50
